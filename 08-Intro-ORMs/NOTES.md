# CRUD REVIEW

1. Review Environment
   * Environment File
   * Gemfile / bundler
   * DB connection
   * We're interacting with Ruby and SQL - the labs already did this
1. Object Relational Mappers
   * Model classes should correspond to Tables in our DB
   * instances of classes should correspond to rows
   * columns of tables correspond to attributes
1. Review CRUD
   * For each SQL statement, a Ruby method to fire it!
   * We'll start small, then abstract some of this away tomorrow
